# Testing

Server-side testing is handled by mocha with code coverage reporting from Istanbul. Running `npm test` in the project root will run the tests and generate a coverage report in `/coverage`.

Test scripts are stored in `src/test`. It is recommended to write unit tests for all public methods in a class and to follow the same folder structure as the app for your tests.
